## 🔐 Security Improvements

### **Authentication Flow:**
```
1. User logs in → username stored in session
2. Every page request:
   ├─ Check if session['login'] is True
   ├─ Get username from session
   ├─ Query: SELECT User_ID FROM login WHERE username = ?
   ├─ Use User_ID to fetch user-specific data
   └─ Return ONLY data belonging to this user
```

### **No More Manual User_ID Entry:**
- ❌ **Before:** Users had to enter their User_ID in forms (security risk!)
- ✅ **After:** User_ID automatically fetched from authenticated session

## 📊 Data Flow Example

**When alice logs in and views request organ page:**

```
1. Login: alice/pass123
   ↓
2. Session stores: username = 'alice'
   ↓
3. Request organ page loads
   ↓
4. Query: SELECT User_ID FROM login WHERE username='alice'
   Result: User_ID = 101
   ↓
5. Query patient requests:
   SELECT ... FROM Patient WHERE User_ID = 101
   Result: Alice's organ requests only
   ↓
6. Display: Only Alice's data shown
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Test Each User's Personalized Data:**

1. ✅ **Login as alice** (User_ID = 101)
   - Dashboard shows Alice's stats
   - Profile shows Alice Johnson's details
   - Request page shows only Alice's requests
   - Donate page shows only Alice's donations
   - Transactions show only Alice's transactions

2. ✅ **Login as bob** (User_ID = 102)
   - Dashboard shows Bob's stats
   - Profile shows Bob Martinez's details
   - Different data from Alice

3. ✅ **Login as charlie** (User_ID = 103)
   - Dashboard shows Carol's stats
   - Profile shows Carol Singh's details
   - Independent data

## 🚀 How to Test

```bash
# 1. Apply the login table updates
mysql -u root -p DBMS_PROJECT < inserting_data/update_login_table.sql
